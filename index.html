        <h3>What is a mechanical keyboard?</h3>
            <p>Mechanical keyboards are the keyboards that most people picture when they think about keyboards; 
                they’re the classic-looking, sturdy keyboards from the 1980s. A more proper definition is that 
                mechanical keyboards are made with high-quality plastic key switches underneath each of the keycaps.</p>
            <br>
            <p>These keyboard switches are comprised of:</p>
            <p>Keycap: the top cap with the letter/number</p>
            <p>Stem: the part underneath the keycap that moves down when pressed</p>
            <p>Housing: the case holding together all the components</p> 
            <br>
            <p>Typing on a mechanical keyboard means pressing down on a keycap,
                    which activates an actual physical switch underneath that’s 
                    spring-loaded. So when you press the key, you feel it and you’ll hear 
                    a “clicking or poppy” sound to let you know that you’ve pressed the key 
                    hard enough to register (and that you haven’t missed a letter or number).
